# Contributing

Thanks for getting involved and contributing to vtvalidate :tada: Below are a few things to setup when submitting a PR.

## Code comments

If adding new code, be sure to include relevant code comments. Code comments are a great way for others to learn from your code. This is especially true within the skeleton, since it is made for learning.

## Update Documentation

Be sure to update any documentation relevant to your change.

## Code Formatting

We use [this script](/scripts/format.sh#L20) to install a consistent version of [`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to format the code base.
